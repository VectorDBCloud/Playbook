- **Details**: Includes tests for query response time, indexing speed, and system throughput.
- **Example**: 

```
python
  results = pgvector.benchmark_performance(vector_db)
```

### Complex Query Handling
- **Purpose**: Evaluate pgvector's capability to efficiently handle complex queries with multiple criteria.
- **Details**: Focuses on search accuracy, response time, and resource utilization.
- **Example**:

```
results = pgvector.advanced_search("complex query", vector_db)
```

### Indexing Strategies
- **Purpose**: Test various indexing strategies to optimize query performance and resource utilization.
- **Details**: Assesses different indexing techniques for their impact on database efficiency.
- **Example**:

```
index_info = pgvector.create_advanced_index("custom_index", vector_db)
```

### Scalability Testing
- **Purpose**: Determine the scalability of pgvector when faced with increasing data volumes and concurrent queries.
- **Details**: Evaluates the database's ability to maintain performance under growing load.
- **Example**:

```
results = pgvector.test_scalability(data_volume=1000000, vector_db=vector_db)
```

## Advanced Functions

### Searching
`pgvector.advanced_search(query, vector_db)`: Performs complex searches using detailed criteria.
- **Example**: `pgvector.advanced_search("advanced machine learning models", vector_db)`
- **Returns**: A list of results matching the query.

### Insertion
`pgvector.insert_advanced(vector, vector_db)`: Inserts a vector with additional metadata for advanced usage.
- **Example**: `pgvector.insert_advanced([0.1, 0.5, 0.3], vector_db)`
- **Returns**: The ID of the inserted vector.

### Update
`pgvector.update_vector(vector_id, new_data, vector_db)`: Updates an existing vector in the database.
- **Example**: `pgvector.update_vector(123, [0.2, 0.6, 0.4], vector_db)`
- **Returns**: The ID of the updated vector.

### Deletion
`pgvector.delete_vector(vector_id, vector_db)`: Deletes a vector from the database.
- **Example**: `pgvector.delete_vector(123, vector_db)`
- **Returns**: Confirmation of deletion.
