## Advanced Functions

### Searching
`qdrant.advanced_search(query, vector_db)`: Performs complex searches using detailed criteria.
- **Example**: `qdrant.advanced_search("advanced NLP queries", vector_db)`
- **Returns**: A list of results matching the query.

### Insertion
`qdrant.insert_advanced(vector, vector_db)`: Inserts a vector with additional metadata for advanced usage.
- **Example**: `qdrant.insert_advanced([0.1, 0.5, 0.3], vector_db)`
- **Returns**: The ID of the inserted vector.

### Update
`qdrant.update_vector(vector_id, new_data, vector_db)`: Updates an existing vector in the database.
- **Example**: `qdrant.update_vector(123, [0.2, 0.6, 0.4], vector_db)`
- **Returns**: The ID of the updated vector.

### Deletion
`qdrant.delete_vector(vector_id, vector_db)`: Deletes a vector from the database.
- **Example**: `qdrant.delete_vector(123, vector_db)`
- **Returns**: Confirmation of deletion.
