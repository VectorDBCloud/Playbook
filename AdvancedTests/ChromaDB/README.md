# Advanced Tests for ChromaDB

This folder contains advanced test scenarios and usage examples for ChromaDB, focusing on complex operations and optimizations. These tests explore the advanced capabilities of ChromaDB and provide guidance on maximizing its potential.

## Introduction

The advanced tests for ChromaDB include scenarios for performance benchmarking, complex query handling, indexing strategies, and scalability testing. These tests are designed to challenge the database under various conditions and help users understand its limits and strengths.

## Test Scenarios

### Performance Benchmarking
- **Purpose**: Assess the performance of ChromaDB under different load conditions.
- **Details**: Measure query response times, indexing speeds, and throughput.
- **Example**: 

  ```
  python
  results = chromadb.benchmark_performance(vector_db)
  ```

# Complex Query Handling
- **Purpose**: Test ChromaDB's ability to handle complex queries with multiple criteria and filters.
- **Details**: Evaluate search accuracy, query response times, and resource utilization.
- **Example**:

```
results = chromadb.advanced_search("multi-criteria query", vector_db)
```

# Indexing Strategies
- **Purpose**: Evaluate the effectiveness of different indexing strategies in ChromaDB.
- **Details**: Compare index creation times, space efficiency, and improvements in query speed.
- **Example**:

```
index_info = chromadb.create_advanced_index("custom_index", vector_db)
```

# Scalability Testing
- **Purpose**: Determine how well ChromaDB scales with increasing data volumes and concurrent queries.
- **Details**: Test data sharding, distributed query processing, and performance degradation.
- **Example**:

```
results = chromadb.test_scalability(data_volume=1000000, vector_db=vector_db)
```

# Advanced Functions

## Searching
`chromadb.advanced_search(query, vector_db)`: Conducts advanced searches using complex criteria.
- **Example**: `chromadb.advanced_search("deep learning models", vector_db)`
- **Returns**: A list of search results matching the query.

## Insertion
`chromadb.insert_advanced(vector, vector_db)`: Inserts a vector with additional metadata for advanced usage.
- **Example**: `chromadb.insert_advanced([0.1, 0.5, 0.3], vector_db)`
- **Returns**: The ID of the inserted vector.

## Update
`chromadb.update_vector(vector_id, new_data, vector_db)`: Updates an existing vector's data.
- **Example**: `chromadb.update_vector(123, [0.2, 0.6, 0.4], vector_db)`
- **Returns**: The ID of the updated vector.

## Deletion
`chromadb.delete_vector(vector_id, vector_db)`: Deletes a vector from the database.
- **Example**: `chromadb.delete_vector(123, vector_db)`
- **Returns**: Confirmation of deletion.
