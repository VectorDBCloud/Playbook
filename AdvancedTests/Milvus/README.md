- **Details**: Includes testing for query execution time, indexing speed, and system throughput.
- **Example**: 

```
  python
  results = milvus.benchmark_performance(vector_db)
```

### Complex Query Handling
- **Purpose**: Assess Milvus's ability to efficiently handle complex queries with multiple parameters.
- **Details**: Focuses on search accuracy, response time, and resource usage.
- **Example**:

```
results = milvus.advanced_search("complex query", vector_db)
```

### Indexing Strategies
- **Purpose**: Evaluate different indexing strategies to optimize query speed and resource usage.
= **Details**: Tests various indexing techniques for their impact on performance.
- **Example**:

```
index_info = milvus.create_advanced_index("custom_index", vector_db)
```

### Scalability Testing
- **Purpose**: Determine the scalability of Milvus when dealing with large datasets and high query volumes.
- **Details**: Examines the database's ability to maintain performance with increasing load.
- **Example**:

```
results = milvus.test_scalability(data_volume=1000000, vector_db=vector_db)
```

## Advanced Functions

### Searching
`milvus.advanced_search(query, vector_db)`: Executes complex searches using detailed criteria.
- **Example**: `milvus.advanced_search("deep learning applications", vector_db)`
- **Returns**: A list of results matching the query.

### Insertion
`milvus.insert_advanced(vector, vector_db)`: Inserts a vector into the database with advanced metadata.
- **Example**: `milvus.insert_advanced([0.1, 0.5, 0.3], vector_db)`
- **Returns**: The ID of the inserted vector.

### Update
`milvus.update_vector(vector_id, new_data, vector_db)`: Updates an existing vector in the database.
- **Example**: `milvus.update_vector(123, [0.2, 0.6, 0.4], vector_db)`
- **Returns**: The ID of the updated vector.

### Deletion
`milvus.delete_vector(vector_id, vector_db)`: Deletes a vector from the database.
- **Example**: `milvus.delete_vector(123, vector_db)`
- **Returns**: Confirmation of deletion.
