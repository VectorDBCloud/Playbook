## Introduction

These tests are designed to verify the basic functionality of Milvus when used with Vector Database Cloud. They cover operations from collection creation to data manipulation and searching.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- `requests` library
- `pandas` library (for data import)
- `sentence_transformers` library (for embedding generation)
- Access to Vector Database Cloud with API URL and API key for Milvus

Install the required libraries using:
```
pip install requests pandas sentence_transformers
```

## Test Scripts

- **CreatingCollections.py**: Creates collections in Milvus.
- **Deletion.py**: Manages deletion operations for vectors and collections.
- **Deployment.py**: Demonstrates the deployment process for Milvus instances.
- **Embedding.py**: Generates and uses embeddings.
- **ImportingData.py**: Imports data into Milvus.
- **Search.py**: Executes search queries in Milvus.

## Usage

1. Set up your environment variables:
   ```
   export VECTORDBCLOUD_MILVUS_API_URL="https://your-vector-db-cloud-url.com"
   export VECTORDBCLOUD_MILVUS_API_KEY="your-api-key"
   ```

2. Run each script individually:
   ```
   python <script_name>.py
   ```

3. Review the output to ensure operations were successful.

Each script is a practical example of operations you can perform with Milvus. Read the script's internal documentation for detailed usage instructions.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set.
2. Check your internet connection and API endpoint accessibility.
3. Verify that you have the correct permissions for the Vector Database Cloud services.
4. For specific error messages, refer to the Milvus documentation or create an issue in this repository.
