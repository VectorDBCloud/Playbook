Welcome to the Vector Database Cloud Playbook! This repository is a comprehensive collection of test scenarios, implementation guides, and best practices for using vector databases like pgvector, Milvus, Qdrant, and ChromaDB. The Playbook serves as a resource for developers, data scientists, and system architects to learn, implement, and optimize vector database solutions.

## What are Vector Databases?

Vector databases are specialized database systems designed to store, manage, and query high-dimensional vector data efficiently. They are crucial for machine learning applications, particularly in areas like natural language processing, computer vision, and recommendation systems.
